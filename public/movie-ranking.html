<h1>Sherrie's Favorite Movies</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Practical Magic</h3>
<p>I love the supernatural magical feeling created by this movie.</p>

<h3>2. Rat Race</h3>
<p>A campy comedy with memorable one-liners like "You should have bought a squirrel!"</p>

<h3>3. Monthy Python and the Holy Grail</h3>
<p>Who can resist this obnoxious British humor?</p>
